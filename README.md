# Mobo-Vacuum
 A bluetooth controlled vacuum cleaner
The main idea of this project is to remove litter from the floor using a vacuum cleaner(Mobo-vacuum) which is controlled by an android device rather than the conventional manual method.
The components required are  Bluetooth module HC-05, Arduino Uno, DC motor, a Chassis, Motor driver L293D and an android device for navigating the remote vacuum cleaner.
After completing the setup, use the arduino code, pair your bluetooth device with the module and use it.
The vacuum cleaner is created by making the motor move in the anti-clockwise direction which can be used to suck air rather than blowing.
This unit has been attached to the chassis and the vacuum cleaner is thus created.
